Multi-Agent Fraud Detection System

This project implements a multi-agent system for fraud detection and analysis using Google ADK (google.adk).
It is designed to analyze uploaded financial transaction files (CSV/Excel) and detect suspicious patterns such as third-party payments and referee anomalies.

Payment Analysis Agent

Detects third-party payments (transactions paid by someone other than the customer).

Third-party flagged transactions.
